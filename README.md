# Dynamic Workflow Design

## Introduction

This research is a system for dynamically generating and visualizing workflows from user requests. It takes a high-level description of a goal, decomposes it into a series of manageable tasks, and constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing the workflow. This allows for complex processes to be automatically planned, validated, and visualized.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Interprets user requests in natural language to understand the desired workflow.
- **Task Decomposition**: Automatically breaks down complex requests into smaller, executable tasks.
- **Workflow Generation**: Constructs a logical workflow (DAG) from the decomposed tasks.
- **Validation**: Checks the generated workflow for structural integrity (e.g., cycles).
- **Visualization**: Generates a visual representation of the workflow graph.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analyzes the complexity of the generated workflow.

## How it Works

The system processes user requests in a multi-stage pipeline:

1.  **Mode Classification**: The initial user request is classified to determine the appropriate workflow generation strategy.
2.  **Decomposition**: The request is broken down into a list of individual tasks. This stage often leverages large language models for sophisticated understanding.
3.  **Workflow Planning**: The system plans the sequence and dependencies of the tasks.
4.  **DAG Construction**: A Directed Acyclic Graph is built based on the planned workflow.
5.  **Validation**: The DAG is validated to ensure it is a valid workflow (e.g., no circular dependencies).
6.  **Visualization**: The final workflow is visualized as a graph and saved as an image.
